# Supreme Group Website Frontend

This repository contains the frontend implementation of the Supreme Group website, developed as part of a technical assessment. The project focuses on building a performant and maintainable frontend based on a provided design.

## 📝 Project Overview

This implementation follows modern frontend development practices to create a responsive, accessible, and performant website for Supreme Group. The project closely adheres to the provided Figma design specifications with attention to pixel-perfect implementation across devices.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Framework: React with Vite
I chose React with Vite for this implementation due to:
- React's component-based architecture that promotes reusability
- Vite's extremely fast development server with hot module replacement
- Efficient production builds with optimized asset handling
- Better developer experience with instant server start

### Language: TypeScript
TypeScript was used as required to ensure type safety, better developer experience, and reduced runtime errors.

### Styling: Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS was selected for its:
- Utility-first approach that accelerates development
- Built-in responsive design system
- Lower CSS bundle size through purging unused styles
- Consistency in design system implementation

### State Management
For this project, I used React's Context API for state management as it provides:
- Sufficient capabilities for the complexity level of this website
- No additional dependencies required
- Simpler implementation than Redux for this scale of application

## 📁 Component Architecture

The project follows a modular component architecture:

```
src/
├── assets/            # Static assets like icons, images, and videos
├── components/        # Reusable UI components
│   ├── Button/        # Button component variations
│   └── Input/         # Form input components
├── layout/            # Layout components for page structure
│   ├── constants/     # Layout-related constants
│   ├── footer/        # Footer components
│   └── header/        # Header and navigation components
└── pages/             # Page components and routing
    └── home/          # Home page components and sections
        ├── components/    # Home-specific components
        ├── constants/     # Home page constants
        └── hooks/         # Custom hooks for home page
```

This architecture supports:
- Component reusability across the application
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy maintenance and scalability
- Isolated testing of components

## 📱 Responsive Design Strategy

The implementation follows a mobile-first approach using Tailwind's responsive breakpoints:
- `sm`: 640px and above (small devices)
- `md`: 768px and above (medium devices)
- `lg`: 1024px and above (large devices)
- `xl`: 1280px and above (extra-large devices)
- `2xl`: 1536px and above (2x-large devices)

Key responsive strategies implemented:
- Fluid typography that scales appropriately across devices
- Flexible grid layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Strategic component stacking on smaller screens
- Conditional rendering for different device sizes when necessary
- Touch-friendly interaction areas on mobile devices

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

Several performance optimization techniques have been implemented:

1. **Code Splitting**: Large components are split into smaller chunks for better loading
2. **Image Optimization**: 
   - Optimized image sizes and formats for different devices
   - Lazy loading for below-the-fold images
3. **Asset Optimization**:
   - SVG optimization for icons
   - Video compression and appropriate format selection
4. **CSS Optimization**:
   - Tailwind's PurgeCSS to eliminate unused styles
   - Critical CSS extraction for above-the-fold content
5. **JavaScript Optimization**:
   - Tree-shaking to eliminate dead code
   - Minification and compression of assets

## ♿ Accessibility Considerations

The implementation prioritizes accessibility through:

1. **Semantic HTML**: Using appropriate HTML5 elements for content structure
2. **ARIA Attributes**: Adding ARIA roles, states, and properties where necessary
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensuring all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
4. **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators and logical tab order
5. **Color Contrast**: Meeting WCAG AA standards for text visibility
6. **Screen Reader Support**: Alt text for images and appropriate aria-labels

## 🧪 Testing

The implementation includes:

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components with React Testing Library
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing component interactions
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Verifying WCAG compliance

## 📚 Third-Party Libraries

The following libraries were used in the implementation:

1. **Axios**: For API requests with better error handling
2. **React Hook Form**: For efficient form handling and validation
3. **clsx**: For conditional class name construction

## 🤔 Assumptions and Decisions

During implementation, the following assumptions were made:

1. **Content Management**: Assumed that content would be primarily static with potential for future CMS integration
2. **Performance Targets**: Optimized for a PageSpeed Insights score of 90+ on mobile
3. **Browser Support**: Targeted modern browsers (last 2 versions) with graceful degradation
4. **API Integration**: Prepared for future API integration with placeholder data structures

## 🧩 Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex Layout Requirements
**Solution**: Utilized a combination of Flexbox and CSS Grid to achieve complex layouts that remain responsive across all device sizes.

### Challenge 2: Responsive Image Management
**Solution**: Created an abstracted image component that handles various breakpoints with appropriate image sizes and formats.

### Challenge 3: Performance on Mobile Devices
**Solution**: Implemented progressive enhancement for mobile users, deferring non-critical JavaScript and optimizing painting performance.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Given more time, the following improvements could be implemented:

1. **Internationalization**: Adding multi-language support
2. **Enhanced Animations**: Adding subtle animations to improve user experience
3. **Enhanced Analytics**: More comprehensive user behavior tracking
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-user monitoring for performance metrics
5. **Microfrontend Architecture**: For better scalability as the application grows
